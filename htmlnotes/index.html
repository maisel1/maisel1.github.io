<h3 id intro_html>Introduction to the <strong>HTML</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The HTML</strong> <ACRONYM>(Hyper Text Markup Language)</ACRONYM> is a <strong>computer Markup
    language</strong> used to define the
    <strong>structure of a page.</strong><br>
    It is composed by elements, also called "tags" that defines the structure of the page.<br>
    To follow an example of element (or tag):
    <mark> &lt;tagname&gt;</mark>
    <i>enter your text here</i>
    <mark>&lt;/tagname&gt.</mark>

<h3 id="intro_css">Introduction to <strong>CSS</strong></h3>
<p>
    <strong>CSS</strong> (Cascade Style Sheet) is a style sheet language used for
    describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects
    such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
    JavaScript.[2]

    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
    separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
    presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
    separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to
    be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
    different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and
    on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
    device.

    <strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class
    functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also
    use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
    Javascript is used by programmers across the world to <strong>create dynamic and interactive web content</strong> like applications
    and browsers. JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in the world, used as a
    client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites.
