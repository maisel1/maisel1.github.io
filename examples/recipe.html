<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong><u>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</u> It has been adapted from a number of different
    recipes that I
    have read over the years.</strong></p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>
    1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br>
    175g of tahini<br>
    6 sundried tomatoes<br>
    Half a red pepper<br>
    A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
    1 clove of garlic<br>
    A dash of olive oil<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time
</p>

<p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p> <!--che palle l'html-->
